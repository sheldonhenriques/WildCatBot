# WildCatBot

Developed WildCatBot, a sophisticated solution that leverages web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from CSU's database. By seamlessly integrating this data with Gemini Pro using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and VectorDB via Langchain, the project achieved a 95% reduction in training costs compared to conventional models. This integration ensures a comprehensive and efficient knowledge base, optimizing information retrieval and utilization.
